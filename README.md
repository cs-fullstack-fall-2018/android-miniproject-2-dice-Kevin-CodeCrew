# Mini-Project - Android Die Roller

Objective: Demonstrate a working knowledge of Android application composition/variables/event handlers/random number generation/ImageViews

### Using the starter code included in this repository, complete the mini-project to create a simple Die Roller application

* Each time the user clicks on the die, roll and display the new value and accompanying image

### Extra Challenges

* When the user rolls the die, by the provided dice roll sound (res/raw/shake_dice.mp3)
